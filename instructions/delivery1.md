## Delivery 1 Description

You are developers at a software development company. You have been contacted by Smart Solutions inc., they have a project called SmartHome, they describe their project below:

    SmartHome+ is a smart-home platform for home users to automate daily home tasks,  reduce energy waste,  and provide home security, and alerts in case of water leaking, fire, etc.
    The main users are the owners of the house, their children and their pets
    The functions of this product will be divided into six categories: 
        1. accessibility (highly desired by the customer); 
        2. environmental considerations (provide a safe environment to live by monitoring quality of air and water);
        3. energy efficiency: live in an efficient way by reducing utility bill costs by waste of energy; 
        4. security is important to the homeowners to keep their home safe; 
        5. media and entertainment; 
        6. automation which require taking as much of the home inhabitants out of routine tasks as possible.

    The summation and harmonization of all the six categories of SmartHome+ will provide for a truly rewarding living experience for the SmartHome+ users.

### Description of tasks involved in the assignment

This assignment has three tasks that are all to be performed in your assigned team of Moodle.

The purposes of the tasks are to give you hands-on practice software engineering requirements elicitation, specification. You are also required to do a postmortem analysis of the techniques you used and to evaluate your work and processes. Below the description of each task:

#### Task 0 - Logging

During all of the work you do on this assignment you must log how much time you spend on each activity and which person(s) in your group does what. Your log should be added as an appendix to your post mortem report described below.  It is highly recommended to create your manuscript using latex and place it in a version control system like Github to track changes, participation of team members, discussion, etc.   In this way, you do not need to spend additional time on task 0.   If you are not familiar with Latex, you could opt for Google docs, which offers the possibility of team collaboration, and history.  However, extracting that information for the purpose of writing the logging must be done manually, while in Git and latex you can always export statistics, generate diff versions of the files, etc.  The data collected from task 0 will be used for the Postmortem report, and at the end of the course for peer assessment.

#### Task 1 – Elicitation

The customer provided you with a general description  about the system in the first page of this document.

In addition, you need to design elicitation artefacts to acquire further information about the software system and what requirements the customer poses on this system.  Remember that POD will play the role of the customer, so you are responsible to apply the elicitation artefacts (for example, questionnaires, interview, background study) and attach them as evidence of your work in this delivery.  For this delivery, you will prepare and submit a  questionnaire (1 for  team)  with 10 questions through Moodle .  The TAs will answer the questionnaire and you will use the information to complete task 1 and 2.  

Complement the results obtained from the questionnaire by studying books, surveys and published articles about Smart homes solutions.  Do not forget to append the list of references at the end of the document.

#### Task 2 – Vision Document

Complete the Vision document based on the following template.  It is important that you add this document to your repository as you might  update it with the information derived from future deliveries.  TA’s might suggest modifications to Delivery 1 that you need to incorporate and will be evaluated in future deliveries.

#### Task 3 – Post mortem

You should conduct a post mortem analysis of the software requirements engineering activities and the whole project of your group assignment. The post mortem should be reported in a separate document from your SRS. It should, in detail, answer the following questions:

    From the elicitation artefacts used in this delivery, answer the following questions:

    What was the advantage of this technique based on your experience in this assignment?
    What was the disadvantage of this technique based on your experience in this assignment?
    How efficient was the technique, i.e. how good requirements did it help uncover given the time it took to use?
    In which situations would you use this technique in a future project? In which situations would you not use this technique in a future project?

    Summarize how much time was spent (in total and by each group member) on the steps/activities involved as well as for the delivery as a whole.  Be honest with the time spent, as this information will in no way be used for any grading.
    In addition to the material seen in class, what other techniques did you apply for completing  this delivery?

    Which techniques worked well
    Which techniques did not work

    How did you work together as a group in the project? What worked well, and what did not work during your interaction(s)? What would you do differently in the future?
